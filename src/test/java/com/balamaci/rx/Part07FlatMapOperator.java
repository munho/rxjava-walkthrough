/**
 * The flatMap operator is so important and has so many different uses it deserves it's own category to explain
 * I like to think of it as a sort of fork-join operation because what flatMap does is it takes individual items
 * and maps each of them to an Observable(so it creates new Streams from each object) and then 'flattens' the
 * events from these Streams back into a single Stream.
 * Why this looks like fork-join because for each element you can fork some async jobs that emit some items before completing,
 * and these items are sent downstream to the subscribers as coming from a single stream
 *
 * RuleOfThumb 1: When you have an 'item' as parameter and you need to invoke something that returns an
 *                    Observable<T> instead of <T>, you need flatMap
 * RuleOfThumb 2: When you have Observable<Observable<T>> you probably need flatMap.
